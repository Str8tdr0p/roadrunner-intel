# Security / Private Disclosure

No binaries in this repo. No PCAPs. No memory dumps.

If you need samples:

- Alternative: ProtonMail address via private message (less preferred).

Handling rules
- Do not run samples outside isolated labs.
- Use private sandboxes or air-gapped VMs.
- Return a short, high-level report: network callbacks (IPs/ports), processes, file writes, YARA/Sigma suggestions.
- Do not publish raw PCAPs or sample binaries.
